    mintSuperTokens(addressToMint, amountToMint);
}
```

```solidity
function burnExample(uint256 amountToBurn) external {
    burnSuperTokens(amountToBurn);
}
```

3. **Transferring Tokens:**
   - Users can use the `transferSuper` function to transfer tokens to other addresses.

```solidity
function transferExample(address recipient, uint256 amountToTransfer) external {
    transferSuper(recipient, amountToTransfer);
}
```
